AI: Hello! Welcome to your interview for the Senior Frontend Developer position. 
    I'm excited to learn more about your background. Could you start by telling 
    me a bit about yourself and your current role?

Candidate: Hi! I'm currently working as a Frontend Developer at TechCorp, where 
          I've been for about 3 years. I specialize in React and TypeScript 
          development, and I've been leading our team's migration to Next.js.

AI: That's great! Leading a Next.js migration sounds like a significant project. 
    What challenges did you face during that migration, and how did you address them?

Candidate: The biggest challenge was managing the transition while keeping our 
          existing features stable. We had to carefully plan the migration in 
          phases, starting with new pages in Next.js while gradually converting 
          older components. I also had to train the team on Next.js best practices.

AI: Excellent approach! It sounds like you have strong project management skills 
    along with your technical expertise. Can you tell me about a specific 
    technical challenge you solved recently?
